        <tr>
          <td>1. Both feet must be in contact with the floor when striking the shuttle</td>
          <td>As you strike the shuttle, part of both feet must be in contact with the ground. You cannot move or lift either foot off the ground until the serve has been struck. 
           This rule is the same for both the server and receiver – the receiver must have both of their feet in contact with the ground until the shuttle has been struck.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>2. Your feet must not be touching any of the court lines</td>
          <td>Your feet cannot be touching any of the lines on the court as you are serving or receiving. You can stand anywhere in your half (even in the tramlines!) as long as you are not touching any of the lines or are outside of the playing court.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. You must strike the cork, not the feathers</td>
            <td>The BWF states that the base of the shuttle (the cork) must be struck first when serving.

                This was added to the rules of the game as many players were gaining an advantage from hitting the feathers first and creating a huge amount of spin on the shuttle! It probably wasn’t great for the durability of the shuttles either… </td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4. The whole shuttle must be struck below 1.15m</td>
            <td>“The whole of the shuttle shall be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the server’s racket.” (BWF Laws of Badminton 9.1.6)

                This is a new rule, brought in by the BWF in March 2018 aimed at “improving the application of the service laws at BWF tournaments” (BWF, 2017). </td>
            <td><img src="https://badminton-insight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_8783-2-1-1024x768.jpg" class="ruleimg"></img></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5. The serve must be delivered in a forward continuous motion</td>
            <td>Once you begin your backswing, the serve must be one continuous motion. At no point during the serving action can you pause.

                Examples of illegal serves under this rule include:
                <ul>
                <li>Stopping at the backswing and then moving forwards</li>
                <li>Moving forwards and backwards multiple times before striking the shuttle</li>
            </ul></td>
            <td></td>
